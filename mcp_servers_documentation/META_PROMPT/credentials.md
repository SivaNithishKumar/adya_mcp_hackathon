# META_PROMPT Server Credentials

_No credentials required to run the Meta-Prompt MCP server locally. The server operates entirely client-side and does not connect to any third-party services._ 

---

## Prerequisite: Install `uv`

The Meta-Prompt MCP server is started via the ultra-fast Python package manager **uv**. If you do not have it yet, install it first (PowerShell example):

```powershell
powershell -c "irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex"
```

macOS / Linux:

```bash
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

After installation make sure `uv --version` works in your terminal.
